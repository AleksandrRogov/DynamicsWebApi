## Usage examples

### For a full documentation please check [DynamicsWebApi on GitHub](https://github.com/AleksandrRogov/DynamicsWebApi).

### Dynamics 365 Web Resource
To use DynamicsWebApi inside Dynamics 365 you need to download a browser version of the library, it can be found in v2 [dist](https://github.com/AleksandrRogov/DynamicsWebApi/tree/v2/dist) folder.

Upload a script as a JavaScript Web Resource, add it to a table form or reference it in your HTML Web Resource and then initialize the main object:

```ts
//By default DynamicsWebApi makes calls to 
//Web API v9.2 and Search API v1.0
const dynamicsWebApi = new DynamicsWebApi();

const response = await dynamicsWebApi.callFunction("WhoAmI");
Xrm.Navigation.openAlertDialog({ text: `Hello Dynamics 365! My id is: ${response.UserId}` });
```

### Node.js
To use DynamicsWebApi in Node.js install the `dynamics-web-api` package from NPM:

```shell
npm install dynamics-web-api --save
```

Then include it in your script:

```ts
//CommonJS
const DynamicsWebApi = require("dynamics-web-api");

//ESM
import { DynamicsWebApi } from "dynamics-web-api";
```

### Example of a Batch Operation using DynamicsWebApi

```ts
const contact = {
    firstname: "John",
    lastname: "Doe"
};

const order = {
    name: "1 year membership",
    //reference a request in a navigation property
    "customerid_contact@odata.bind": "$1"
};

dynamicsWebApi.startBatch();
dynamicsWebApi.create({ data: contact, collection: "contacts", contentId: "1" });
dynamicsWebApi.create({ data: order, collection: "salesorders" });

const responses = await dynamicsWebApi.executeBatch();

//in this case both ids exist in a response
//which makes it a preferred method
const contactId = responses[0];
const salesorderId = responses[1];
```
